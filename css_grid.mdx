## Basic

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(300px, 100%), 1fr));
```

```auto-fit```: If you have extra space, `auto-fit` stretches the columns to fill the entire row.

`minmax()`: This defines the size range for each column

- The Minimum: min(300px, 100%)

- The Maximum: 1fr (one fraction of the remaining space).

`min(300px, 100%)`:

- Normally, we'd just put 300px here. However, if the screen is only 280px wide (like an old phone), a fixed 300px would cause horizontal scrolling.

- By using min(300px, 100%), you are saying: "Be 300px wide, unless the screen is smaller than 300px, in which case just take up 100% of the width."
